<h2>What is Rock Paper Scissors Game?</h2>
<p font-size: 18px>Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game typically played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: rock, paper, or scissors. The game follows a set of rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. It's often used as a quick decision-making tool or as a casual game. The appeal of rock-paper-scissors lies in its simplicity, luck, and a hint of strategy, as players can sometimes predict their opponentâ€™s choices based on previous moves.</p>
